# Reflection â€“ Git & GitHub

**1. What did you learn about using Git and GitHub?**  
I learned how to track changes in my code using Git and how to upload my work to GitHub using the terminal.

**2. What was most confusing or frustrating?**  
Sometimes I forgot to save files before committing, which made Git think nothing changed. Also, remembering the correct order of Git commands took some practice.

**3. Why do you think developers use Git?**  
Because it helps them keep track of all code changes, collaborate with others, and avoid losing work.

**4. How might this help with larger projects in the future?**  
It makes teamwork easier and keeps all changes organized so you can always go back to a previous version if needed.
